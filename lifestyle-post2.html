<p id="writing"><br> Dear reader, <br>

<br>Today, I am going to be sharing a few of my all-time favorite teas for stress relief. I am always stressed and overwhelmed with school, extracurricular activities, friends and family, and just life in general. I have found that these tips and tricks really seem to make a difference and help me. <br>
Over time, I have learned that two specific teas help me most and are my go-to relievers for when I’m stressed. They are:  chamomile and linden teas.<br>

Chamomile tea is a popular home remedy tea.<br><br>

Here are of few of the benefits of using chamomile tea:<br>
-        It can be used to calm an upset stomach<br>
-        It can be used to help with sleeping problems<br>
-        It can be used to help with swelling of the skin<br>
-        It can be used to help fight bacteria<br>
-        It can be used to help with stomach cramps<br><br>

Here are a few of the benefit of linden tea:<br><br>
-        It can be used for stress-relief<br>
-        It can be used for colds, stuffy nose, breathing problems, fever and sore throat<br>
-        It can be used for rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure, and nervous tension<br>
-        It can be used for sleeping problems (such as insomnia) <br><br>

I love mixing these two teas. Typically, I add in lemon juice and sometimes I like to add honey (when I want something sweet). I also like mixing honey and lemon for a sweet/sour, delicious taste. When I drink tea, I love to drink it out of a cute mug. I typically change them seasonally (I know, I’m weird), but I always have my go-to Disney mug and my HUGE Henri Bendel mug! After all, a nice mug is an essential accessory. Some would even say I’m a bit obsessed with tea. If you girlies try these tips, please leave a comment down below letting me know if the teas worked. As always, I LOVE hearing from you!<br><br>

Thanks for reading!<br><br>

<br>XOXO,<br>
  <br>Amanda</p>
