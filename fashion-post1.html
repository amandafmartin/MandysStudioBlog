<p id="writing"> Dear reader,<br>

<br>Today, I will be sharing with you a few of my summer essentials. Summer is the time to hang out with friends, go to the beach, and have fun. These are a few essentials that will help you have a great summer: <br> 

<br>Fashion:<br>
A maxi dress is a summer staple. Maxi dresses are SUPER comfy and easy to wear. They also come in really cute prints and colors, such as tie-dye or bright colors. Denim shorts are also a must. I like blue denim year-round, but during the summer, I prefer colorful denim. Target and Forever 21 have great selections. Colorful tank tops and T-shirts are essential. I love to dress them up and make them a bit more girly.  I like using bold statement necklaces to achieve this look. Forever 21 carries really cute jewelry (and T-shirts) at affordable prices. Target has some of my favorite T-shirts, tank tops, and jewelry as well.<br>

<br>Beauty:<br>
I tend to gravitate towards really minimal and easy makeup. I love wearing light makeup, such as a BB cream or mineral foundation. I like the Olay Fresh Effects BB cream and the Neutrogena Mineral Sheers Powder Foundation. Currently, I am trying out Bare Minerals and thus far, I am LOVING it! A good foundation and eye primer are year round essentials. During the warmer months, my makeup does not stay in place and a good primer prevents it from running. I am obsessed with the Benefit Cosmetics The POREfessional foundation primer and the Stay Dont Stray eyelid primer (which doubles as an under-eye concealer). Cream blush and eye-shadow are also important. My favorite cream blush is the Maybelline Dream Bouncy Blush in the shade Candy Coral. Another amazing option for cream eye-shadow is the Maybelline Color Tattoo in the shade Barely Branded (a perfect champagne shade). Colorful nail polish should not be forgotten (consider blue, green, purple, and coral colors). Cover Girl makes some of my all-time favorite drugstore nail polishes. I highly recommend them. My last summer beauty essential is a tinted lip balm with SPF. I am crazy over the Maybelline Baby Lips. The entire original collection contains SPF 20 and they all smell AMAZING! The limited edition collections do not have SPF but I still highly recommend them (tip: get a regular lip balm with SPF and then apply the Baby Lips on top, that way you get SPF and hydration). I also LOVE Lip Smackers. They smell, feel, and taste good, and they sometimes have a tint. I donâ€™t think those will ever get old. <br>

<br>Food: <br>
Fruit and vegetables are essentials of mine. They are both refreshing and hydrating.  Another essential of mine are popsicles. They are refreshing and the perfect summertime snack. I also love eating trail mix for energy.  I buy mine from Target because they have a huge selection.

<br><br>There you have it. These are my summer essentials. Please leave a comment down below telling me what your summer essentials are. I would love to know. Thanks for reading! <br>
