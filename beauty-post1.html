  <p id="writing"><br>Dear reader, <br>

<br>I recently placed an order online and purchased the Essence I Love Stage Eyeshadow Base. I ordered this product because I was running out of my all-time favorite, Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion. I decided to try a new one. I chose this particular product because it was in-expensive and I had never heard anyone talk about it. So, I decided to put it to the test.<br>

<br>I wore it on a casual day (when I stayed at home), on a school day (wearing it through P.E and cheer practice), and I wore it on a night out. I did not have good results. I do not like this eyeshadow base at all. I had an allergic reaction to it (my eyes burned and stung), my eyeshadows creased almost instantly, and it did not prolong the wear of the shadow. It is also SUPER orange and it looked as if I had spread carrot baby food all over my eyes. It was not a good look to say the least.  I think that there are way better eyeshadow primers and bases on the market.<br>

<br> If you have had a similar experience with this product, please leave a comment down below. If you have had a good experience, I would like to hear from you too.  What are your favorite eyeshadow bases and/or primers?<br>

<br>As always, I would love to hear from you. So, please leave a comment with your ideas and thoughts. I will be sure to check it out. Thanks! <br>

Overall opinion: I did not like this product and would not recommend it.<br>

 <br><br>XOXO,<br><br>
 Mandy
