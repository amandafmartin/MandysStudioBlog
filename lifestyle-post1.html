 <p id="writing"><br>Dear reader,<br><br>
<br.Today, I am going to be sharing with you a “coconut body scrub recipe”. This recipe is SUPER simple and quick. It also has AMAZING results.
<br> Ingredients:
<br> 1-1½ tbs. virgin coconut oil {should be solid} (found in the organic section of grocery store or health food store)
<br>¼ -½ cup of sugar (I like raw sugar because the granules are bigger which makes the scrub more abrasive)
<br>1 glass bowl<br>
Directions:<br>
     <br> 1) Scoop out coconut oil into the glass bowl.
     <br> 2) With spoon, flatten the coconut oil. This makes it easier to mix the sugar with the oil.
     <br> 3)  Pour sugar onto the flattened coconut oil and begin to mix. This might take a few moments because the oil is a solid, which makes it harder to mix. Don’t worry though, the results are worth it.
     <br> 4)   Once fully mixed, the scrub is ready for use. <br>
Results: <br>
The scrub will leave your skin soft, moisturized, shiny, and smelling amazing!<br>

That’s it! I hope you girls enjoyed. As always, let me know what suggestions or ideas you have for future posts. I love hearing from you. Thanks! <br>
   
   <br> XOXO, <br>
